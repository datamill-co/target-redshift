# Changelog

# 0.2.5

- **FEATURES:**
  - [Added the `default_max_bytes_per_character`](https://github.com/datamill-co/target-redshift/pull/9) config option which allows users to declare a default maximum number of bytes to allow per incoming character.  For example, a field in the schema
  declared with `maxLength: 100` with a `default_max_bytes_per_character: 2` will end up as a `varchar(200)` field.  Fields
  with no `maxLength` declared will get `varchar(<default_column_length>)` as before.  `default_max_bytes_per_character` defaults to
  `4` to allow for up to 4 byte UTF and avoid backwards-compatibility issues.

## 0.2.0

- **NOTE:** The `minor` version bump is not expected to have much effect on folks. This was done to signal the
  output change from the below dependency bump. It is our impression not many are using this feature yet anyways. Since
  this was _not_ a `patch` change, we decided to make this a `minor` instead of `major` change to raise _less_
  concern. Thank you for your patience! Please see the below dependency change for more information.
